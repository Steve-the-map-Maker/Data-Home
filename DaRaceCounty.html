      <h2>Understanding the Vote Distribution</h2>
      <p>
        The data indicates a competitive race, with each district showing varied
        support for the candidates. The distribution of votes across districts
        highlights different levels of candidate preference, which can provide
        insights into regional support trends and voter turnout.
      </p>

      <p>
        Comparing county-wide results to the City of Portland's results, Nathan
        Vasquez generally leads in both contexts. However, the vote distribution
        in the city shows a more pronounced lead for Vasquez, especially in
        District 4, suggesting stronger urban support. This highlights potential
        differences in voting patterns between urban and broader county regions.
      </p>

      <h2>Methods</h2>
      <p>
        This section describes the data processing and visualization methods
        used in this analysis.
      </p>

      <h3>Data Processing</h3>
      <p>
        The data normalization process was critical in ensuring fair comparison
        across different precincts. By normalizing the vote counts, we were able
        to highlight the relative performance of candidates in smaller versus
        larger precincts. This process involved adjusting vote counts to a
        common scale, which mitigated the effect of varying precinct sizes.
        Transparency in the visualization was used to represent this normalized
        data, where higher transparency indicated lower normalized values, and
        vice versa. This approach provided a clearer visual distinction between
        precincts with varying levels of voter support.
      </p>

      <h3>Data Visualization</h3>
      <p>
        The map visualization employs a color gradient to depict the percentage
        of votes for Nathan Vasquez across different precincts. The colors range
        from light purple to black, where lighter shades represent lower
        percentages and darker shades represent higher percentages. Transparency
        is also used to indicate the normalized vote counts, with lower
        transparency for smaller precincts and higher transparency for larger
        ones.
      </p>

      <p>The following colors and districts are highlighted on the map:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Multnomah Co Commissioner District 1:</strong> Light Coral
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Multnomah Co Commissioner District 2:</strong> Medium Sea
          Green
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Multnomah Co Commissioner District 3:</strong> Cornflower Blue
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Multnomah Co Commissioner District 4:</strong> Medium Orchid
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        To read the dashboard, look at the color intensity and transparency of
        each precinct. Darker colors indicate higher support for Nathan Vasquez,
        while lighter colors indicate lower support. The transparency level
        helps you understand the relative size of the precinct in terms of
        normalized vote counts. District boundaries are outlined in different
        colors for easy identification.
      </p>

      <p>Interactive features include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Hovering over precincts to change the cursor to a pointer, indicating
          interactivity.
        </li>
        <li>
          A button to toggle between the full map and only the City of Portland,
          allowing users to focus on urban voting patterns.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This comprehensive visualization provides a clear and interactive way to
        understand the election results, highlighting both the geographical and
        numerical differences in voter support across Multnomah County.

      <h3 class="text-center mt-5">How the Map Was Made</h3>
      <p>
        The interactive map of the Vasquez vs Schmidt 2024 race was created
        using several tools and data sources to provide an accurate view of the
        electoral landscape across Multnomah County.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Mapping Library:</strong> The map is built using
          <a href="https://maplibre.org/" target="_blank">MapLibre</a>, an
          open-source mapping library that allows for the creation of
          high-quality, interactive maps.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Basemap:</strong> The basemap used is from
          <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank"
            >OpenStreetMap</a
          >, a community-driven and detailed geographic data provider.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Sources:</strong> The election results data was sourced
          from Multnomah County. The precinct-level results were joined with
          GeoJSON boundary data to visualize the voting patterns across the
          county effectively.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The process of creating this map involved integrating data from
        different sources, cleaning and transforming it to be suitable for
        mapping, and then visualizing the data in an interactive format to help
        users understand the voting distribution across Multnomah County and the
        City of Portland.
