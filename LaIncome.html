        <h3 class="text-center mt-5">Los Angeles and Orange County Income Distribution: Data Overview</h3>
        <p>Welcome to my interactive analysis of income levels across Los Angeles and Orange County. This dashboard helps visualize the median income of each census tract and provides an understanding of the economic landscape in the region.</p>
        <h4>Income Levels Across Census Tracts</h4>
        <p>My data breaks down the median income for different census tracts across LA and Orange County:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Below $30,000: Areas with the darkest shades of green indicate higher income levels.</li>
            <li>$30,000 - $60,000: These areas are represented by a medium shade of green, showing moderate income levels.</li>
            <li>$60,000 - $90,000: Lighter shades of green represent census tracts with median incomes falling in this range.</li>
            <li>Above $90,000: The lightest areas represent the regions with the lowest income levels.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The map offers a dynamic way to interact with the data, showing trends and disparities across the regions of interest.</p>

        <h4>Visual Analysis</h4>
        <p><strong>Interactive Map:</strong> The interactive web map provides a detailed spatial breakdown of the median income distribution across the Los Angeles area. The gradient colors visually represent varying income levels, with darker greens indicating higher incomes and lighter shades indicating lower ones.</p>
        <p><strong>Income Distribution Chart:</strong> The chart displays income distribution within the region, highlighting the number of census tracts in each income bracket.</p>
        <p>These visualizations aim to make it easier to understand income inequalities and the diversity of economic statuses across different neighborhoods in Los Angeles and Orange County.</p>

        <!-- How the Map Was Made Section -->
        <section class="container my-5">
            <h3 class="text-center mt-5">How the Map Was Made</h3>
            <p>The interactive map was created using several tools and data sources to provide an accurate representation of income distribution across Los Angeles and Orange County.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mapping Library:</strong> The map is built using <a href="https://maplibre.org/" target="_blank">MapLibre</a>, an open-source mapping library that allows for high-quality, interactive visualizations.</li>
                <li><strong>Basemap:</strong> The basemap used is from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank">OpenStreetMap</a>, which provides a detailed and community-driven geographic base layer.</li>
                <li><strong>Frontend Framework:</strong> The application is developed using <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a>, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, which enables dynamic rendering of map components.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Sources:</strong> The data used in the map comes from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Census Bureau</a>. Specifically, it combines two different datasets: census tract data and income data. These datasets were joined using census tract identifiers to provide a complete view of the income distribution.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The process of creating the map involved integrating these data sources and technologies, performing data cleaning and transformation, and ultimately visualizing the data in an interactive manner that makes it easy to understand spatial patterns in income across the region.</p>
