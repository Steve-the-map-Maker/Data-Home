        <h3 class="text-center mt-5">Portland Age Demographic Distribution: Data Overview</h3>
        <p>Welcome to our detailed analysis of Portland's age demographic distribution. This overview focuses solely on the data, providing insights into how different age groups are spread across the city's neighborhoods.</p>
        <h4>Census Tracts by Age Range</h4>
        <p>Our data reveals significant variations in the median age across different census tracts within Portland:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>18-30 years: 3 tracts</li>
            <li>31-40 years: 120 tracts</li>
            <li>41-50 years: 44 tracts</li>
            <li>51-60 years: 4 tracts</li>
            <li>61+ years: 0 tracts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The majority of census tracts have a median age between 31 and 40 years, indicating a concentration of this age range within the city.</p>
        <h4>Population Distribution by Age Group</h4>
        <p>The population distribution across different age groups is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>18-30 years: 25,175 individuals</li>
            <li>31-40 years: 39,060 individuals</li>
            <li>41-50 years: 151,207 individuals</li>
            <li>51-60 years: 131,808 individuals</li>
            <li>61+ years: 213,764 individuals</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A substantial portion of Portland's population falls within the 61+ years age range, highlighting the dominance of this demographic in the city.</p>
        <h4>Understanding the Age Distribution</h4>
        <p>Despite the 61+ years age group being the largest in terms of population size, the median age of the population is younger, specifically between 31 and 40 years. This discrepancy can be attributed to the distribution of the population across various age groups. While the 61+ age group has a significant number of individuals, the combined population of younger age groups (18-30 years, 31-40 years, and 41-50 years) is substantial enough to lower the overall median age. Additionally, the presence of younger families and working-age adults in Portland contributes to a lower median age, reflecting a balanced age distribution rather than a skewed one.</p>
        <h4>Visual Analysis</h4>
        <p><strong>Interactive Map:</strong> Our interactive map provides a spatial representation of the age demographics across Portland. Each area is color-coded to reflect the median age range, allowing users to quickly identify neighborhoods with specific age characteristics.</p>
        <p><strong>Bar Chart:</strong> The bar chart displays the number of census tracts within each median age range. It clearly shows that the 31-40 years age range is the most prevalent, with 120 tracts falling into this category.</p>
        <p><strong>Pie Chart:</strong> The pie chart breaks down the population by age group, emphasizing that the majority of Portland's population is within the 61+ years range. This chart offers a quick overview of the population distribution across different age groups.</p>
