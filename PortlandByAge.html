        Portland Age Demographic Distribution: Data Overview
      </h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to our detailed analysis of Portland's age demographic
        distribution. This overview focuses solely on the data, providing
        insights into how different age groups are spread across the city's
        neighborhoods.
      </p>
      <h4>Census Tracts by Age Range</h4>
      <p>
        Our data reveals significant variations in the median age across
        different census tracts within Portland:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>18-30 years: 3 tracts</li>
        <li>31-40 years: 120 tracts</li>
        <li>41-50 years: 44 tracts</li>
        <li>51-60 years: 4 tracts</li>
        <li>61+ years: 0 tracts</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The majority of census tracts have a median age between 31 and 40 years,
        indicating a concentration of this age range within the city.
      </p>
      <h4>Population Distribution by Age Group</h4>
      <p>
        The population distribution across different age groups is as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>18-30 years: 25,175 individuals</li>
        <li>31-40 years: 39,060 individuals</li>
        <li>41-50 years: 151,207 individuals</li>
        <li>51-60 years: 131,808 individuals</li>
        <li>61+ years: 213,764 individuals</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A substantial portion of Portland's population falls within the 61+
        years age range, highlighting the dominance of this demographic in the
        city.
      </p>
      <h4>Understanding the Age Distribution</h4>
      <p>
        Despite the 61+ years age group being the largest in terms of population
        size, the median age of the population is younger, specifically between
        31 and 40 years. This discrepancy can be attributed to the distribution
        of the population across various age groups. While the 61+ age group has
        a significant number of individuals, the combined population of younger
        age groups (18-30 years, 31-40 years, and 41-50 years) is substantial
        enough to lower the overall median age. Additionally, the presence of
        younger families and working-age adults in Portland contributes to a
        lower median age, reflecting a balanced age distribution rather than a
        skewed one.
      </p>
      <h4>Visual Analysis</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Interactive Map:</strong> Our interactive map provides a spatial
        representation of the age demographics across Portland. Each area is
        color-coded to reflect the median age range, allowing users to quickly
        identify neighborhoods with specific age characteristics.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Bar Chart:</strong> The bar chart displays the number of census
        tracts within each median age range. It clearly shows that the 31-40
        years age range is the most prevalent, with 120 tracts falling into this
        category.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Pie Chart:</strong> The pie chart breaks down the population by
        age group, emphasizing that the majority of Portland's population is
        within the 61+ years range. This chart offers a quick overview of the
        population distribution across different age groups.

    <!-- How the Map Was Made Section -->
    <section class="container my-5">
      <h3 class="text-center mt-5">How the Map Was Made</h3>
      <p>
        The interactive map was created using several tools and data sources to
        provide an accurate representation of income distribution across the
        city of Portland.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Mapping Library:</strong> The map is built using
          <a href="https://maplibre.org/" target="_blank">MapLibre</a>, an
          open-source mapping library that allows for high-quality, interactive
          visualizations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Basemap:</strong> The basemap used is from
          <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank"
            >OpenStreetMap</a
          >, which provides a detailed and community-driven geographic base
          layer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Sources:</strong> The data used in the map comes from the
          <a href="https://www.census.gov/" target="_blank"
            >U.S. Census Bureau</a
          >. Specifically, it combines two different datasets: census tract data
          and income data. These datasets were joined using census tract
          identifiers to provide a complete view of the age distribution.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The process of creating the map involved integrating these data sources
        and technologies, performing data cleaning and transformation, and
        ultimately visualizing the data in an interactive manner that makes it
        easy to understand spatial patterns in age across the region.
